xMail - PHP Server
===================

This is the xMail PHP server. You will need some PHP knowledge in order to get this going, as it will NOT work out of the box.
The server is designed to be implemented into your server environment, rather than dropped in. 

With the xMail default settings, xMail tries to use the "mail" folder, hence why that is there. Inside you will see a bunch
of PHP files, those are the xMail server files. The core of the server is in the index page.

Feel free to edit/modify the server to your needs, however the xMail developers do not take liability for damages because of 
incorrect code in any case (whether it be yours or our code). If you come upon any issues, contact us. We'll try to help out
the best we can.

The xMail PHP server is not backed by a whole lot of PHP knowledge, so the code is likely "bad" in that sense. 

See "xMail.sql" for the SQL schema.
